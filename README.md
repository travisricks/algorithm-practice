These were basic and fairly simple, but it was good practice for writing algorithms and associated tests.

- [Falsy bouncer](fcc-basic-algorithms/13-falsy-bouncer/index.js) - remove all falsy values from an array 😀
- [Where do I belong?](fcc-basic-algorithms/14-where-do-I-belong/index.js) - find the index in an array where a number can be inserted assuming all values are put into ascending order 👨‍🎓
