# Algorithm Practice

Pulled from various sources, this is a collection of algorithms for me to practice with.

## Algorithms Solved

- [Calculate Change Back](cc-loose-change/loose-change.js) - Given an input of XXÂ¢, calculate the change back in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

## Tests

Most algorithms have tests written in Mocha and Chai.
