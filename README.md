# Algorithms Practice

Pulled from various sources, this is a collection of algorithms for me to practice with.

## Algorithms Solved

### Source: Code Chrysalis

- [Calculate Change Back](code-chrysalis-algorithms/loose-change/loose-change.js) - Given an input of XXÂ¢, calculate the change back in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

### Source: [FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/)

These were basic and fairly simple, but it was good practice for writing algorithms and associated tests.

- [Reverse a String](fcc-basic-algorithms/02/02-reverse-a-string.js)

## Algorithms Not Solved (YET)

### Source: Code Chrysalis

- [Rotate Matrix](code-chrysalis-algorithms/rotate-matrix/rotate-matrix.js)

## Tests

Most algorithms have tests written in Mocha and Chai.
